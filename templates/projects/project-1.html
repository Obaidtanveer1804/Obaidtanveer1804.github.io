    <p>
      During my tenure at <strong>Powersoft 19</strong>, I designed and developed a <strong>Battery Management System (BMS)</strong> for monitoring and controlling battery cells in a classified application. This project involved the integration of the <strong>LTC6804</strong> battery cell monitor IC with an <strong>STM32 microcontroller</strong>, utilizing the <strong>DC1941D</strong> isoSPI-to-SPI converter module from Analog Devices. I also developed a desktop application using <strong>.NET</strong> and <strong>C#</strong> to provide a user interface for data visualization and control.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Battery Management System was designed to monitor and manage a stack of battery cells, ensuring safe operation by tracking key parameters such as voltage, temperature, state of charge (SoC), and state of health (SoH). The system used the <strong>LTC6804</strong> IC to interface directly with the battery cells, communicating over <strong>isoSPI</strong> via the <strong>DC1941D</strong> module to an STM32 microcontroller. The STM32 processed the data and transmitted it over <strong>CANbus</strong> to other nodes in the system, while a desktop application provided real-time monitoring and control capabilities.
    </p>

    <h2>System Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The BMS architecture centered around the <strong>LTC6804</strong>, a high-precision battery monitoring IC capable of measuring up to 12 cells in series with a total measurement error of less than 1.2 mV. The LTC6804 communicated over <strong>isoSPI</strong>, a differential communication protocol that ensures robust data transmission in noisy environments. The <strong>DC1941D</strong> module converted the isoSPI signals to standard SPI, which was then interfaced with an <strong>STM32F4 microcontroller</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The STM32 handled data acquisition, processing, and communication. It used <strong>SPI</strong> to retrieve cell voltages and temperatures from the LTC6804, and <strong>UART</strong> for receiving control commands (e.g., setting charge/discharge limits). The processed data was transmitted over <strong>CANbus</strong> using a predefined message format, allowing any node on the network to access the BMS data. A second STM32 node was configured to receive and log this data for redundancy and system-level integration.

    <p><em>Note: I have taken this image from Analog Devices.</em></p>

    <h2>Data Acquisition and Processing</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>LTC6804</strong> was configured to perform continuous monitoring of the battery stack, measuring cell voltages with 16-bit resolution and temperatures via external thermistors. The STM32 firmware implemented a polling mechanism to retrieve data from the LTC6804 at a rate of 10 Hz, ensuring real-time monitoring. The raw data was filtered using a moving average algorithm to reduce noise, and the SoC was calculated using a coulomb-counting method combined with a lookup table for improved accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safety features included overvoltage, undervoltage, and overtemperature detection, with configurable thresholds set via UART commands. If any parameter exceeded the defined limits, the STM32 triggered a fault condition, halting charge/discharge operations and sending an alert over CANbus.
    </p>

    <h2>Communication and Control</h2>
    <p>
      The STM32 used <strong>CANbus</strong> to transmit BMS data to other nodes in the system. The CAN messages followed a custom protocol, with each message containing a unique identifier, cell data (voltage, temperature, SoC), and fault status. This allowed for seamless integration with other system components, such as a master controller or a data logger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Control commands were sent to the STM32 via <strong>UART</strong> from an external device. These commands included setting charge/discharge limits, enabling/disabling balancing, and requesting diagnostic data. The firmware included a command parser to interpret and execute these instructions, with error checking to ensure reliable operation.
    </p>

    <h2>Desktop Application Development</h2>
    <p>
      To provide a user-friendly interface, I developed a desktop application using <strong>.NET Framework</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>. The application communicated with the STM32 over <strong>Ethernet</strong> using a TCP/IP socket, receiving BMS data in real-time. The GUI was built with <strong>WPF</strong> (Windows Presentation Foundation) and featured:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time graphs of cell voltages, temperatures, and SoC using a charting library (e.g., LiveCharts).</li>
      <li>Individual cell data display with color-coded indicators for fault conditions.</li>
      <li>Controls to set charge/discharge limits and enable/disable cell balancing.</li>
      <li>A diagnostic panel for viewing system status and fault logs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The application implemented a multi-threaded architecture to handle data streaming and UI updates concurrently, ensuring a responsive user experience. Data was parsed and stored in a local SQLite database for historical analysis, with export functionality to CSV for further processing.
    </p>

    <h2>Workflow</h2>
    <p>
      The development of the BMS followed a structured workflow to ensure reliability and performance:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Hardware Setup:</strong> Connected the battery cells to the LTC6804 IC, interfaced with the DC1941D module, and connected the module to the STM32 via SPI.</li>
      <li><strong>Firmware Development:</strong> Wrote STM32 firmware to handle SPI communication with the LTC6804, UART for control, and CANbus for data transmission. Implemented data processing algorithms (filtering, SoC calculation) and safety features.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication Testing:</strong> Validated CANbus communication with a secondary STM32 node, ensuring data integrity and proper message formatting.</li>
      <li><strong>Desktop Application Development:</strong> Built the .NET application with WPF, integrating real-time data streaming over Ethernet, graphical visualization, and control features.</li>
      <li><strong>System Integration:</strong> Integrated the hardware and software components, testing the BMS under various operating conditions (e.g., high load, fault scenarios).</li>
      <li><strong>Deployment and Validation:</strong> Deployed the system in a controlled environment at Powersoft 19, validating its performance against design specifications.</li>
    </ol>
