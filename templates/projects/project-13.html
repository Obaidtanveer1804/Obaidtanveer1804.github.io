    <p>
      As part of my advanced robotics work at <strong>Esforge Pvt Ltd</strong>, I led the development of a <strong>SCARA Robot</strong> integrated with <strong>ROS2</strong>, showcasing my expertise in robotic operating systems, motion planning, and embedded systems. This project demonstrated my ability to design, simulate, and deploy a high-precision robotic arm for industrial automation tasks.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm)</strong> was developed to perform precise pick-and-place operations for industrial automation, capable of achieving a repeatability of <strong>±0.1 mm</strong>. The robot was controlled using <strong>ROS2</strong>, enabling modular, scalable, and real-time robotic control. The system was designed to handle tasks such as assembly, material handling, and precision placement, with seamless integration of hardware and software components.

    <h2>System Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The SCARA robot utilized a <strong>STM32</strong> microcontroller as the primary controller for low-level motor control and sensor interfacing, interfaced with a <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> running <strong>ROS2</strong> for high-level control and communication. The STM32 handled real-time tasks such as motor control and encoder feedback, while the Raspberry Pi managed <strong>ROS2</strong> nodes for motion planning, trajectory generation, and communication with external systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system leveraged <strong>ROS2</strong>’s publish-subscribe model for efficient communication between nodes, ensuring low-latency coordination between the robot’s joints, sensors, and control algorithms. I developed custom <strong>ROS2</strong> packages to handle the robot’s kinematics and dynamics, enabling smooth and accurate operation.
    </p>

    <h2>ROS2 Implementation</h2>
    <p>
      I designed and implemented a comprehensive <strong>ROS2</strong> architecture for the SCARA robot, utilizing <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>C++</strong> for node development. Key <strong>ROS2</strong> components included:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong style="color: var(--clr-accent)">MoveIt</strong>: Configured for motion planning, generating collision-free trajectories for the SCARA robot’s 4 degrees of freedom (DOF).</li>
      <li><strong style="color: var(--clr-accent)">RViz</strong>: Used for real-time visualization of the robot’s state, joint positions, and planned trajectories.</li>
      <li><strong style="color: var(--clr-accent)">Gazebo</strong> and <strong style="color: var(--clr-accent)">CoppeliaSim</strong>: Employed for simulation, allowing testing and optimization of control algorithms before hardware deployment.</li>
      <li>Custom <strong style="color: var(--clr-accent)">ROS2</strong> nodes for interfacing with the <strong style="color: var(--clr-accent)">STM32</strong> via <strong style="color: var(--clr-accent)">UART</strong>, ensuring reliable data exchange for motor commands and sensor feedback.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <strong>ROS2</strong> system was optimized for real-time performance, achieving a control loop frequency of <strong>100 Hz</strong>, critical for precise robotic operations.
    </p>

    <h2>Motor Control and Firmware Development</h2>
    <p>
      The SCARA robot was equipped with <strong>NEMA 17</strong> stepper motors for its joints, driven by <strong style="color: var(--clr-accent)">DRV8825</strong> drivers supporting up to <strong>1/32 microstepping</strong>. I developed firmware for the <strong>STM32</strong> to control the motors, implementing closed-loop control using <strong style="color: var(--clr-accent)">AS5600</strong> magnetic encoders for precise joint positioning. The firmware included <strong style="color: var(--clr-accent)">PID</strong> control algorithms to minimize positional errors and ensure smooth motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also created a custom <strong style="color: var(--clr-accent)">C++</strong> library for the STM32 to handle inverse kinematics calculations, translating <strong>ROS2</strong> trajectory commands into joint-specific motor movements.
    </p>

    <h2>Simulation and Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Extensive simulations were conducted using <strong style="color: var(--clr-accent)">CoppeliaSim</strong> to validate the robot’s kinematics and control algorithms. I modeled the SCARA robot in <strong>CoppeliaSim</strong>, integrating it with <strong>ROS2</strong> to test motion planning and obstacle avoidance. This simulation-driven approach reduced development time and ensured robust performance before hardware deployment.

    <h2>Hardware Integration</h2>
    <p>
      I designed a custom <strong>PCB</strong> to integrate the <strong>STM32</strong>, motor drivers, and encoder interfaces, ensuring a compact and reliable control system. The PCB supported high-speed communication with the Raspberry Pi via <strong style="color: var(--clr-accent)">UART</strong> and included power management for stable operation under varying loads.
    </p>
    <p>
      The robot’s mechanical design, created using <strong style="color: var(--clr-accent)">SolidWorks</strong>, was optimized for rigidity and precision, with custom end-effectors for pick-and-place tasks. I collaborated with mechanical engineers to align the hardware design with <strong>ROS2</strong> control requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>Deployment and Performance</h2>
    <p>
      The SCARA robot was deployed in a controlled environment, achieving a cycle time of <strong>1.5 seconds</strong> for pick-and-place operations. The <strong>ROS2</strong> system enabled real-time monitoring and dynamic trajectory adjustments, ensuring adaptability to varying task requirements. The robot maintained a repeatability of <strong>±0.1 mm</strong>, meeting industrial standards for precision.
